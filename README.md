"# KD-Tree-with-KNN" <br/>
The data file contains information about a patient's cell. The data is comprised of the patient's ID, a diagnosis (malignant or benign) and some more attributes usually used for diagnosis. A K-nearest neighbour machine learning algorithm is trained on the data set and used to identify the nearest points to an input and make a prediction.
